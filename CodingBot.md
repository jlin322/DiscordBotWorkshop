# Coding Our Discord Bot
## Discord Bot Applications

### Welcome new users to discord server
```python
import os
import discord
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv() #take environment variables from .env
TOKEN = os.getenv('DISCORD_TOKEN')

client = discord.Client()

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'{client.user.name} has connected to Discord!')

@client.event
async def on_member_join(member):
    await member.create_dm()
    await member.dm_channel.send(
        f'Hi {member.name}, welcome to my Discord server!'
    )

client.run(TOKEN)
```
* Note: You may have to install the python dotenv module for this program to work. You can do this by running pip install -U python-dotenv from your command line (this should work for everyone).
* on_ready() is a function that registers to listen to. In the case, the event associated with on_ready() is the member joining the discord server. When that event has successfully completed, on_ready will be called.
* The other function here, on_member_join(), tells the program what to do when a new member joins the server. When the function is called, the program will wait for the member argument to create a direct message channel to communicate with the bot. When that's done, a greeting will be sent to the user before the function returns.

### Respond to messages from users
```python
async def on_message(message):
	if message.content.startswith('$hello'):
		await message.channel.send('Hello World!')
```
* Another thing you can do with discord bots is use them to respond to messages from users based on what the message says. In this example, we are telling the bot to respond to a message beginning with "hello" with "Hello World!"
* You can use the same function to respond to any message with any response you like.

### Handling errors
```python
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author == client.user:
    if message.content == 'HackBU is the best club ever':
        response = "Duh"
        await message.channel.send(response)
    elif message.content == 'raise-exception':
        raise discord.DiscordException
```
* Lastly, you can use the discord API to raise errors based on user input. In this example, if a user types 'raise-exception' in the chat bar and hits send, the bot will respond by raising an exception.
* If you want to experiment, feel free to mess around with the message you use to raise an exception. You can also raise exceptions in any function by adding the line ```raise discord.DiscordException``` so have fun with it!
